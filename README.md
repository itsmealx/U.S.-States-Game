- Tracks and displays correct answers on the map
- Saves correctly guessed states to a file for future use
- Clean, modular codebase designed for easy expansion
🧠 Upcoming Enhancements
- Savepoint system to resume progress across sessions
- Timer Feature
🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Turtle graphics
- Pandas (for data manipulation)
- CSV for state coordinates and progress tracking
💡 Why This Project?
This game is part of my ongoing journey to master Python, modular design, and data-driven applications. It’s a hands-on way to explore concepts like:
- Separation of concerns
- Error handling and validation
- Data persistence and resume logic
- UX polish in CLI-based games
